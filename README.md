# Brief Report

## Abstract

DOTA2 is a team oriented multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game with 6.5 million monthly players published by Valve Corporation. In each match, two teams of five players select and control ‘heros’ which have unique attributes and play one of nine possible roles on a team.

Apriori association rule mining is used to identify essential hero roles that should be present on each team. Clustering is used to identify types of teams that players can form. Lastly, linear regression is used to identify factors that that increase the chance of winning a combat engagement called a team fight, which result in a the temporary death of 3 or more players.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to discover detailed insights to inexperienced beginner players to the implicit strategies of the game. Another objective of this project is for the developers of Dota 2, the increase in these metrics can increase the number of regular players they have,improve the user experience, and drive up other essential metrics such as revenue.

# Personal Contributions - Clustering

#### Main Hypotheses - K Means Clustering

K Means should result in three different team types (3 clusters should be most optimal) such that one type is offensive, one type is defensive, and the last type is a balanced team. A balanced team is a team that has a good mix of defensive heroes and offensive heroes.
